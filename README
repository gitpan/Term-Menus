NAME
    Term::Menus - Create Powerful Terminal, Console and CMD Enviroment Menus

SYNOPSIS
    "use Term::Menus;"

    see METHODS section below

DESCRIPTION
    Term::Menus allows you to create powerful Terminal, Console and CMD
    environment menus. Any perl script used in a Terminal, Console or CMD
    environment can now include a menu facility that includes sub-menus,
    forward and backward navigation, single or multiple selection
    capabilities, dynamic item creation and customized banners. All this
    power is simple to implement with a straight forward and very intuitive
    configuration hash structure that mirrors the actual menu architechture
    needed by the application. A separate configuration file is optional.
    Term::Menus is cross platform compatible.

    Term::Menus is a stand-alone - other CPAN modules are not needed for its
    implementation ( so it's *easy* to install! ;-) )

    Term::Menus was initially conceived and designed to work seemlessly with
    the soon-to-be-released perl based Network Automation Utility called
    FullAuto - however, it is not itself dependant on other FullAuto
    components, and will work with *any* perl script/application.

    Reasons to use this module are:

    * You have a list (or array) of items, and wish to present the user a
      simple CMD enviroment menu to pick a single item and return that item
      as a scalar (or simple string). Example:

         use Term::Menus;

         my @list=('First Item','Second Item','Third Item');
         my $banner="  Please Pick an Item:";
         my $selection=&pick(\@list,$banner);
         print "SELECTION = $selection\n";

      The user sees ==>

         Please Pick an Item:

            1.        First Item
            2.        Second Item
            3.        Third Item

         (Press "q" to quit)

         PLEASE ENTER A CHOICE:

      --< 2 >-<ENTER>----------------------------------

      The user sees ==>

         SELECTION = Second Item

    * You have a large list of items and need scrolling capability:

         use Term::Menus;

         my @list=`ls -1 /bin`;
         my $banner="   Please Pick an Item:";
         my $selection=&pick(\@list,$banner);
         print "SELECTION = $selection\n";

      The user sees ==>

         Please Pick an Item:

            1.        arch
            2.        ash
            3.        awk
            4.        basename
            5.        bash
            6.        cat
            7.        chgrp
            8.        chmod

    any bugs or have suggestions for improvements.

  What To Know Before Using
    * There are two methods available with Term::Menus - &pick() and
      &Menu(). "&Menu()" uses "&pick()" - you can get the same results using
      only "&Menu()". However, if you need to simply pick one item from a
      single list - use "&pick()". The syntax is simpler, and you'll write
      less code. ;-)

    * You'll need to be running at least Perl version 5.002 to use this
      module. This module does not require any libraries that don't already
      come with a standard Perl distribution.

METHODS
    pick - create a simple menu
            $pick = &pick ($list|\@list|['list',...],[$Banner]);

        Where *$list* is a variable containing a array or list reference.
        This argument can also be a escaped array (sending a reference) or
        an anonymous array (which also sends a reference).

        *$Banner* is an optional argument sending a customized Banner to top
        the simple menu - giving instructions, descriptions, etc. The
        default is "Please Pick an Item:"

    Menu - create a complex Menu
            $pick  = &Menu ($list|\@list|['list',...],[$Banner]);

        Where *$pick* is a variable containing a array or list reference of
        the pick or picks.

            @picks = &Menu ($Menu_1|\%Menu_1|{ Label => 'Menu_1' });

        Where *$Menu_1* is a hash reference to the top level Menu
        Configuration Hash Structure.

  Menu Configuration Hash Structures
        These are the building blocks of the overall Menu architecture. Each
        hash structure represents a *menu screen*. A single menu layer, has
        only one hash structure defining it. A menu with a single sub-menu
        will have two hash structures. The menus connect via the "Result"
        element of an *Item* - "Item_1" - hash structure in parent menu
        %Menu_1:

           my %Menu_2=(

              Label  => 'Menu_2',
              Item_1 => {

                 Text   => "]Previous[ is a ]Convey[ Utility",
                 Convey => [ 'Good','Bad' ]
              },

              Select => 'One',
              Banner => "\n   Choose an Answer :"
           );

           my %Menu_1=(

              Label  => 'Menu_1',
              Item_1 => {

                 Text   => "/bin/Utility - ]Convey[",
                 Convey => [ `ls -1 /bin` ],
                 Result => \%Menu_2,

              },

              Select => 'One',
              Banner => "\n   Choose a /bin Utility :"
           );

   Menu Component Elements
    Each Menu Configuration Hash Structure consists of elements that define
    and control it's behavior, appearance, constitution and purpose. An
    element's syntax is as you would expect it to be in perl - a key string
    pointing to an assocaited value: "key => value". The following items
    list supported key names and ther associated value types:

    *   Display => 'Integer'

    *

        * The *Display* key is an *optional* key that determines the number
          of Menu Items that will be displayed on each screen. This is
          useful when the items are multi-lined, or the screen size is
          bigger or smaller than the default number utilizes in the most
          practical fashion. The default number is 10.

             Display => 15,

    *   Label => 'Char String consisting of ASCII Characters'

    *

        * The *Label* key provides a unique identifier to each Menu
          Structure. *Every Menu Configuration Hash Structure must have a
          valid and unique Label element* Otherwise "&Menu()" will throw an
          error.

             Label => 'Menu_1',

    *   Item_<int> => { Item Configuration Hash Structure }

    *

        * The *Item_<int>* elements define customized menu items. There are
          essentially two methods for creating menu items: The *Item_<int>*
          elements, and the "]Convey[" macro (described later). The
          difference being that the "]Convey[" macro turns an Item
          Conguration Hash into an Item *Template* -> a powerful way to
          *Item*-ize large lists or quantities of data that would otherwise
          be difficult - even impossible - to anticipate and cope with
          manually.

             Item_1 => { Text => 'Item 1' },
             Item_2 => { Text => 'Item 2' },

          Items created via "]Convey[" macros have two drawbacks:

          * They all have the same format.

          * They all share the same "Result" element.

          The syntax and usage of *Item_<int>* elements is important and
          extensive enough warrant it's own section. See *Item Configuration
          Hash Structures* below.

    *   Select => 'One' --or-- 'Many'

    *

        * The *Select* element determines whether this particular menu layer
          allows the selection of multiple items - or a single item. The
          default is 'One'.

             Select => 'Many',

    *   Banner => 'Char String consisting of ASCII Characters'

    *

        * The *Banner* element provides a customized descriptive header to
          the menu. *$Banner* is an optional element - giving instructions,
          descriptions, etc. The default is "Please Pick an Item:"

             Banner => "The following items are for selection,\n".
                       "\tEnjoy the Experience!",
             
   Item Congfiguration Hash Structures
    Each Menu Item can have an independant configurtion. Each Menu
    Configuration Hash Structure consists of elements that define and
    control it's behavior, appearance, constitution and purpose. An
    element's syntax is as you would expect it to be in perl - a key string
    pointing to an assocaited value: key => value. The following items list
    supported key names and ther associated value types:

    *   Text => 'Char String consisting of ASCII Characters'

    *

        * The *Text* element provides a customized descriptive string for
          the Item. It is the text the user will see displayed, describing
          the selection.

             Text => 'This is Item_1',

    *   Convey => [ List ] --or-- @List --or-- $Scalar --or-- 'ASCII String'

    *

        * The *Convey* element has a twofold purpose; it provides for the
          contents of the "]Convey[" macro, and defines or contains the
          string or result that is passed on to child menus - if any. Use of
          this configuration element is *optional*. If "Convey" is not a
          list, then it's value is passed onto child menus. If "Convey" *is*
          a list, then the Item selected is passed onto the children - if
          any. It is important to note, *when used*, that only the resulting
          *Convey* string - *NOT* the the Item "Text" value or string, is
          conveyed to child menus. When the "Convey" element is not used,
          the full Item "Text" value is conveyed to the children - if any.
          However, the full contents of the "Text" element is *returned* as
          the *Result* of the operation when the user completes all menu
          activity. See the *Macro* section below for more information.

             Convey => [ `ls -1` ] ,

    *   Default => 'Char String' --or-- Perl regular expression - qr/.../

    *

        * The *Default* element provides a means to pre-select certain
          elements, as if the items were selected by the user. This can be
          done with two constructs - simple string or pre-compiled regular
          expression. Note: The "Default" element is available only when the
          "Select" element is set to 'Many' - "Select =" 'Many',>

        * The *Include* element provides a means to create items filtered
          from a larger list of potential items available via the "]Convey["
          macro. This element is useful only when the "]Convey[" macro is
          used to populate items. The "Exclude" element can be used in
          conjunction with "Include" to further refine the final list of
          items used to construct the menu. The "Include" element - when
          used - always takes presidence, and the "Exclude" will be used
          only on the "Include" filtered results. This element can be used
          with two value constructs - simple string or pre-compiled regular
          expression.

             Include => qr/base|chown/i,

    *   Result => \%Menu_2 --or -- "&any_method()",

    *

        * *Result* is an *optional* element that also has two important
          uses:

        * For selecting the child menu next in the chain of operation and
          conveyance,

             Result => \%Menu_2,

          --or--

        * For building customized method arguements using "&Menu()"'s
          built-in macros.

        *
             Result => "&any_method($arg1,\"]Selected[\",\"]Previous[\")",

          NOTE: *ALWAYS* be sure to surround the subroutine or method
          calling syntax with DOUBLE QUOTES. (You can use single quotes if
          you don't want interpolation). Quotes are necessary because you're
          telling "&Menu()" - *not* Perl - what method you want invoked.
          "&Menu()" won't invoke the method until after all other processing
          - where Perl will try to invoke it the first time it encounters
          the line during runtime - lo----ng before a user gets a chance to
          see or do *anything*. BUT - be sure *NOT* to use quotes when
          assigning a child menu reference to the "Result" value.

          Again, *Result* is an *optional* element. The default behavior
          when "Result" is omitted from the Item Configuration element, is
          for the selection to be returned to the "&Menu()"'s calling
          script/module/app. If the "Select" element was set to 'One', then
          that item is returned regardless of whether the Perl structure
          receiving the output is an array or scalar. If there were multiple
          selections - i.e., "Select" is set to 'Many' - then, depending on
          what structure is set for receiving the output, will determine
          whether "&Menu()" returns a list (i.e. - array), or *reference* to
          an array.

   Item Congfiguration Macros
    Each Menu Item can utilize a very powerful set of configuration
    *Macros*. These constructs principally act as purveyors of information -
    from one menu to another, from one element to another. There are
    currently three available Macros:

    *   ]Convey[

    *

        * "]Convey[" is used in conjunction with the *Convey* element
          (described) earlier. It's purpose to "convey" or transport or
          carry a list item associated with the "Convey" element - and
          replace the "]Convey[" Macro in the "Text" element value with that
          list item. The *Convey* mechanism utilizing the "Convey" Macro is
          essentially an *Item multiplier*. The entire contents of the list
          associated with the *Convey* element will be turned into it's own
          "Item" when the menu is displayed.

             use Term::Menus;

             my %Menu_1=(

USAGE and NAVIGATION
    Usage of "&pick()" and/or "&Menu()" during the runtime of a script in
    which one or both are included, is simple and intuitive. Nearly
    everything the end user needs in terms of instruction is included
    on-screen. The script-writer/developer/programmer can also include
    whatever instructions s/he deems necessary and/or helpful in the
    customizable "Banner" (as described above). There is however, one
    important feature about using "&Menu()" with sub-menus that's important
    to know about.

   Forward  ' > ' and  Backward  ' < ' Navigation
    When working with more than one "&Menu()" screen, it's valuable to know
    how to navigate back and forth between the different "&Menu()"
    levels/layers. For example, above was illustrated the output for two
    layers of menus - a parent and a child:

        This submenu of selections works just like any other menu. The user
        can deselect an item, clear all items, re-choose all items, etc. The
        choices made here are preserved when-or-if the user navigates back
        to the original (parent) menu. In other words, if Item 1. is
        deselected in the sorted menu, Item 1. will also be deselected in
        the parent menu above.

   View Summary of Selected Items ' * '
    When working with numerous items in a single menu, it is desirable to
    see the set of choices made before leaving the menu and committing to a
    non-returnable forward (perhaps even critical) process. Term::Menus
    provides this feature with the *Star* ' * ' key. Assume we have the
    following menu with 93 Total Choices. Assume further that we have
    selected items 1,3,9 & 11. Note that we cannot see Item 11 on the first
    screen since this menu is configured to show only 10 Items at a time.
