        * Version 1.25 released.

        * Bug Fix - %{$LookUpMenuName} was not being populated properly
                    when using multiple menus defined in main:: and
                    not a separate menu_cfg.pm file.

2007-08-31  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 1.22 released.

        * Tweaked the POD documentation so that all examples
          listed will print output to the console. This was
          a potentially confusing omission.

        * Added ability to call custom subroutine to create Text Items
          and customized Banners. When using sub menus, previous selections
          from parent menus are available for use in dynamically constructing
          the current menu. Documentation was updated to explain this new
          feature

        * Also, sub-menus now seem to work fairly reliably - so the caveat
          against their aggressive use has been removed from the documentation

          - 'not' Menus (my bad)

2005-05-29  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 1.08 released.

        * Repaired code related to dynamic menu building.
          The construct ]Previous[{Menu_1} now works properly.

2005-05-22  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 1.06 released.
